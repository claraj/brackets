Brackets generator for a tournament

User can enter team names, and generate brackets for matchups.

User will be prompted to enter winner of each matchup

Activity neutral, so a specific scoring system is not implemented - just who won

Keeps track of winners of each bracket.


todo test - there are some bugs

todo what is happening with Bracket's phantom parcelable implementation?

Some suggested extension features:

* Deal with rotation correctly, save instance state
* draw diagram of current state of tournament; or some other visual representation
* Manage multiple tournaments
* Edit list of competitors before starting tournament
* Specific scoring systems e.g. if customized for soccer, you could store the scores/results of matches
* Email or otherwise share results
* Is slow for large numbers of competitors. Can you think of some ways to speed it up?
* Your own ideas!
